Message_0_Page_0 We have <b>6 achievable ranks</b>. You start as a <color=uncommon>Cadet</color>, then it goes <color=rare>Hoplite</color>, <color=rare>Captain</color>, <color=epic>Battalion Leader</color>, <color=epic>Colonel</color>, and finally <color=legendary>Brigadier</color>. After that come management seats, but they are currently all full.
