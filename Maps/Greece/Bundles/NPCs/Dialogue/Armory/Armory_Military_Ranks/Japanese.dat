Message_0_Page_0 Ah, There are <b>6 achievable ranks</b>. You always start as a <color=uncommon>Private</color>, then it goes <color=rare>Lance Corporal</color>, <color=rare>Corporal</color>, <color=epic>Sergeant</color>, <color=epic>Sergeant First Class</color>, and then <color=legendary>Master Sergeant</color>. Officer ranks are very rarely given out, especially these days.
Message_0_Page_1 Doing tasks for your assigned area is much more likely to encourage <color=mythical>High Command</color> to give you a promotion. When that happens, report to me and I'll give you your new equipment.
