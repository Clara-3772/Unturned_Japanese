Message_0_Page_0 Hello there! You're a new face around here! It can get a bit dark in here, but it is a much safer place to call home!
Message_0_Page_1 When everything first happened I was living in Trikala! After the outbreak I heard about this bunker and thought I would make the long drive.
Message_0_Page_2 Unfortunately, my RV took quite a beating on the way here.<pause> I'm not a very skilled adventurer, so I haven't been able to get the stuff I need to fix her!
Message_1_Page_0 Careful out there!
Message_2_Page_0 I suggest you leave! <i>*Glares at you*</i>
